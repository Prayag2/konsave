## Editing the configuration file
You can make changes to Konsave's configuration file according to your needs. The configuration file is located in `~/.config/konsave/config.yaml`.
When using Konsave for the first time, you'll be prompted to enter your desktop environment.  
For KDE Plasma users, the configuration file will be pre-configured.

### Format
The configuration file should be formatted in the following way:
```
---
save:
    name:
        location: "path/to/parent/directory"
        entries: 
        # These are files to be backed up.
        # They should be present in the specified location.
            - file1
            - file2
export:
    # This includes files which will be exported with your profile.
    # They will not be saved but only be exported and imported.
    # These may include files like complete icon packs and themes..
    name:
        location: "path/to/parent/directory"
        entries: 
            - file1
            - file2
...
```

### Adding more files/folders to backup
You can add more files/folders in the configuration file like this:
```
save:
    name:
        location: "path/to/parent/directory"
        entries:
            - file1
            - file2
            - folder1
            - folder2
export:
    anotherName:
            location: "another/path/to/parent/directory"
            entries:
                - file1
                - file2
                - folder1
                - folder2
```

### Using placeholders
You can use a few placeholders in the `location` of each entry in the configuration file. These are:  
`$HOME`: the home directory
`$CONFIG_DIR`: refers to "$HOME/.config/"
`$SHARE_DIR`: refers to "$HOME/.local/share"
`$BIN_DIR`: refers to "$HOME/.local/bin"
`${ENDS_WITH="text"}`: for folders with different names on different computers whose names end with the same thing.
The best example for this is the ".default-release" folder of firefox.
`${BEGINS_WITH="text"}`: for folders with different names on different computers whose names start with the same thing.


```
save:
    firefox:
        location: "$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/${ENDS_WITH='.default-release'}"
        entries:
            - chrome
```
