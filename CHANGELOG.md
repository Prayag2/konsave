## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2021-09-07
### Added
- The following placeholders for `config.yaml` were added:
    1. `$SHARE_DIR`: It points to `$HOME/.local/share`
    2. `$BIN_DIR`: It points to `$HOME/.local/bin`

### Changed
- Now, there's no need to check for the ID of a profile if you already know its name. You can remove, apply and export a profile using its name. For example `konsave --export myprofile`. See [#38](https://github.com/Prayag2/konsave/issues/38)
- Replaced the words "variables and functions" with "placeholders".
- Updated readme.

### Removed
- You'll no longer be able to use IDs to remove, apply and export profiles. You have to use the name of the profile to do so.
- The following placeholders were removed:
    - `$KONSAVE_DIR`
    - `$CONFIG_DIR`

## [2.0.2] - 2021-04-13
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug with export. Previously, exporting a profile would export the current profile but now it will export the specified profile.
- Fixed a typo in the readme

## Added
- Added a line in the readme

## [2.0.1] - 2021-04-11
### Removed
- KDE Plasma won't be restarted after applying a new configuration now. You'll have to restart it yourself. This was done because using Konsave on other DEs would give an error.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-04-11
### Added
- Possibility to define multiple backup targets via the configuration file.
- Errors will be saved to `konsave_log.txt` in the home directory.
- Ability to use a few variables and functions in the configuration file.
- Ability to use Konsave on all desktop environments.

### Changed
- Improved export and import feature. You'll be able change which files to export and import from the configuration file.
- Changed yaml loader from `yaml.FullLoader` to `yaml.SafeLoader`
- The version will now be dynamically printed.

### Break
- The old configuration files and profiles won't work with this version of Konsave.

## [1.1.9] - 2021-03-18
### Fixes
- Fixes [#26](https://github.com/Prayag2/konsave/issues/26)
- Prints help when entering "konsave" without any arguments

## [1.1.8] - 2021-03-18
### Changes
- Add missing new lines at end of `.pylintrc` and `CONTRIBUTION.md`.
- Gitignore:
    - Common VS Code and JetBrains IDE user-specific stuff.
    - All `__pycache__` dirs (`**/__pycache__`).
- Delete and untrack all `*.pyc` files.
- Reformat and improve some docstrings.
- Remove some excessive comments, e.g. `## IMPORTS ##` or `# WIPE`. The import section is clear and visible enough to not need such additional comment. Same with functions - docstrings do that job well.
- Refactor and simplify CLI argument parsing.
- Adapt `setup.py` to use pip requirement text files.
    - Create extra `dev` and corresponding `requirements_dev.txt` requirement text file. Can be installed via `pip install -e .[dev]` or from PyPI via `pip install konsave[dev]`.
- Remove "Dependencies" section from `README.md` - dependencies get installed automatically anyway.

- Changed `check_error` function to a decorator (Thanks to (this article)[https://medium.com/swlh/handling-exceptions-in-python-a-cleaner-way-using-decorators-fae22aa0abec]) for easier maintenance.
- Improved logging

## [1.1.4] - 2021-03-07

## [1.1.3] - 2021-03-06
### Changes
- Fixed something

## [1.1.2] - 2021-03-06

## [1.1.1] - 2021-03-06

## [1.1.0] - 2021-03-06

## [1.0.7] - 2021-03-06
### Changes
- bug fixes

## [1.0.6] - 2021-03-06
### Changes made by @majabojarska
- Add GitHub Actions workflow "Release". Runs on tag push, named v* (e.g. v1.0.5). This workflow creates a GitHub release and publishes the package to PyPI repository.
- Change setup.py manual versioning to SCM versioning - the tag's version determines the package's version. This means that tag v1.0.5 results in package version 1.0.5 on PyPI. This also means that the package version won't be maintained via source code, but via Git tags.


## [1.0.5] - 2021-03-06
### Changes
- Fixed a small mistake with the versioning

## [1.0.4] - 2021-03-05

### Changes
- Deployed it to PyPI!

## [1.0.2] - 2021-02-28
### Changes

## [1.0.1] - 2021-02-28
### Changes
- Bug fixes
- Better import and export
    + It will now export and import the installed themes, icons, cursors and plasmoids so there will be no need to install the themes manually on other machines.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-02-27
### Changes
